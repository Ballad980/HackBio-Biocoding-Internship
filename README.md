# HackBio-Biocoding-Internship
This repository contains all projects carried out during the HackBio Coding for Biologist internship.

## STAGE ZERO TASK##
I'll start by introducing you to my team mates - check stage Zero/Team information DataFrame folder.
For this task, I used the HackBio built-in R Studio, however, this task can be performed using a downloded R and R studio, Kaggle, or even here on GitHub.

# Data Gathering/Dataframe creation
The details _name, slack_username, email, hobby, country, discipline, and preferred_language_ were gotten and each store in different vectors.
These vectors were combined to give a comprehensive information of the various members of the team. 
Check the stage Zero folder for the codes, you can even replicate and put fun information together using R codes.
