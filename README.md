# HackBio-Biocoding-Internship
This repository contains all projects carried out during the HackBio Coding for Biologist internship.

# STAGE ZERO TASK
I'll start by introducing you to my team mates - check stage Zero/Team information DataFrame folder.
For this task, I used the HackBio built-in R Studio, however, this task can be performed using a downloded R and R studio, Kaggle, or even here on GitHub.

 ## _Data Gathering/Dataframe creation_
The details _name, slack_username, email, hobby, country, discipline, and preferred_language_ were gotten and each store in different vectors.
These vectors were combined to give a comprehensive information of the various members of the team. 
Check the stage Zero folder for the codes, you can even replicate and put fun information together using R codes. 

# STAGE ONE TASK
For this task, I wrote custom functions to carry out multiple operations including translating DNA to protein, calculating hamming distance, 
simulating a population growth curve and calculating time to reach 80 percent carrying capacity. All codes can e found in the stage one folder.

# STAGE TWO TASK
For this stage, I created various visualizations including plots showing growth curve of bacteria replicates, Volcano plot showing gene mutation in cancer, bar and pie plots showing amino acids responsible 
for protein structure and function. Laced into this was data wrangling and transformation.
