**Questions**
Plot all the growth curves of OD600 vs Time for the different Strains with the following instructions:

# Getting url and reading in the data(everything will be done in Base R)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/2025_project_collection/refs/heads/main/Python/Dataset/mcgc.tsv"
#You can install readr pakage to use read.delim()
data <- read.table(url, sep = "\t", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
print(head(data))

*For each strain, plot a growth curve of the the knock out (-) an knock in (+) strain overlaid on top of each other*

#I'll write a function that plots the graph for reproducibility
line_plot <- function(time, wildA, mutantA, wildB, mutantB,wildC, mutantC, title){
    #Create an empty plot with proper axis labels and title
    ## using 'n' in type ensures no plot is shown
    plot(time,wildA, type = "n", xlab = "Time", ylab = "OD600",
     main = paste("Growth curve for",title),
     ylim = range(c(wildA, mutantA, wildB, mutantB, wildC, mutantC)))  # Ensure all lines fit
    #plot lines
    lines(time, wildA, type = "l", col = "blue4")
    lines(time, mutantA, type = "l", col = "dodgerblue")
    lines(time, wildB, type = "l", col = "green4")
    lines(time, mutantB, type = "l", col = "lightgreen")
    lines(time, wildC, type = "l", col = "red4")
    lines(time, mutantC, type = "l", col = "tomato2")
    #Add legend
    legend("bottomright", legend = c("WildtypeA", "MutantA","WildtypeB", "MutantB","WildtypeC", "MutantC"),
       col = c("blue4", "dodgerblue","green4","lightgreen","red4","tomato2"), lty = 1)
}
# Using the function
line_plot(data$time, data$A1, data$A2, data$B1, data$B2,data$C1, data$C2, title="Strain1_Rep1")
line_plot(data$time, data$A3, data$A4, data$B3, data$B4,data$C3, data$C4, title="Strain1_Rep2")
line_plot(data$time, data$A5, data$A6, data$B5, data$B6,data$C5, data$C6, title="Strain2_Rep1")
line_plot(data$time, data$A7, data$A8, data$B7, data$B8,data$C7, data$C8, title="Strain2_Rep2")
line_plot(data$time, data$A9, data$A10, data$B9, data$B10,data$C9, data$C10, title="Strain3_Rep1")
line_plot(data$time, data$A11, data$A12, data$B11, data$B12,data$C11, data$C12, title="Strain3_Rep2")


*Using your function from last stage, determine the time to reach the carrying capacity for each strain/mutant*

# Function to determine time to reach carrying capacity
carrying_cap_time <- function(time, od_list){
    # Initialize a vector to store the max times
    max_times <- numeric(length(od_list))
    #create a for loop to loop through each od value and return their max time
    for (i in seq_along(od_list)){ #loop through each OD vector
        od <- od_list[[i]] #get the current od vector
        #find the index where od reaches its maximum value
        index_max <- which.max(od)
        # Store corresponding time
        max_times[i] <- time[index_max]
    }
    # separate odd and even indices
        max_times_even <- max_times[seq(2, length(max_times), by = 2)]
        max_times_odd <- max_times[seq(1, length(max_times), by = 2)]
        
        # Create result
        final_result <- data.frame("Wildtype" = max_times_odd,
                                   "Mutant" = max_times_even)
    return(final_result)
}   

*Generate a scatter plot of the time it takes to reach carrying capacity for the knock out and the knock in strains*
Generate a box plot of the time it takes to reach carrying capacity for the knock out and the knock in strains
Is there a statistical difference in the time it takes the knock out strains to reach their maximum carrying capacity compared to the knock in strains
