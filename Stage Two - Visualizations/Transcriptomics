This is a processed RNAseq dataset involving reading in quantitated gene expression data from an RNA-seq experiment, 
exploring the data using base R functions and then interpretation. The dataset contains an experiment between a diseased 
cell line and diseased cell lines treated with compound X. The difference in expression change between the two health status is 
computed as Fold change to log 2 (Log2FC) and the significance of each is computed in p-value.

*Task 4*

top_downregulated <- downregulated$Gene[1:5]

            "Top 5 downregulated genes are:", top_downregulated))

#Getting their functions from genecards database
Top upregulated genes
1. EMILIN2: May be responsible for anchoring smooth muscle cells to elastic fibers, and may be involved not only in the formation of the elastic fiber,
                but also in the processes that regulate vessel assembly.
            Has cell adhesive capacity. 
2. POU3F4: Probable transcription factor which exert its primary action widely during early neural development and in a very limited set of neurons in the 
                  mature brain.
3. LOC285954: NA
4. VEPH1: Interacts with TGF-beta receptor type-1 (TGFBR1) and inhibits dissociation of activated SMAD2 from TGFBR1, impeding its nuclear accumulation 
                and resulting in impaired TGF-beta signaling.
          May also affect FOXO, Hippo and Wnt signaling
5. DTHD1: NA

Top downregulated genes
1. TBX5: DNA-binding protein that regulates the transcription of several genes and is involved in heart development and limb pattern formation.
         Binds to the core DNA motif of NPPA promoter.
2. IFITM1: FN-induced antiviral protein which inhibits the entry of viruses to the host cell cytoplasm, permitting endocytosis, but preventing 
             subsequent viral fusion and release of viral contents into the cytosol.
           Active against multiple viruses, including influenza A virus, SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2), Marburg virus (MARV), Ebola virus (EBOV),
             Dengue virus (DNV), West Nile virus (WNV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (PubMed:26354436, 33270927).
          Can inhibit: influenza virus hemagglutinin protein-mediated viral entry, MARV and EBOV GP1,2-mediated viral entry and SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S 
             protein-mediated viral entry.
          Also implicated in cell adhesion and control of cell growth and migration (PubMed:33270927).
          Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated syncytia formation (PubMed:33051876).
          Plays a key role in the antiproliferative action of IFN-gamma either by inhibiting the ERK activation or by arresting cell growth in G1 phase in a 
             p53-dependent manner.
          Acts as a positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation.
          In hepatocytes, IFITM proteins act in a coordinated manner to restrict HCV infection by targeting the endocytosed HCV virion for lysosomal degradation.
          IFITM2 and IFITM3 display anti-HCV activity that may complement the anti-HCV activity of IFITM1 by inhibiting the late stages of HCV entry, possibly in 
           a coordinated manner by trapping the virion in the endosomal pathway and targeting it for degradation at the lysosome.
3. LAMA2: Binding to cells via a high affinity receptor, laminin is thought to mediate the attachment, migration and organization of cells into tissues 
          during embryonic development by interacting with other extracellular matrix components.
4. CAV2: May act as a scaffolding protein within caveolar membranes.
         Interacts directly with G-protein alpha subunits and can functionally regulate their activity.
         Acts as an accessory protein in conjunction with CAV1 in targeting to lipid rafts and driving caveolae formation.
         The Ser-36 phosphorylated form has a role in modulating mitosis in endothelial cells.
         Positive regulator of cellular mitogenesis of the MAPK signaling pathway.
         Required for the insulin-stimulated nuclear translocation and activation of MAPK1 and STAT3, and the subsequent regulation of cell cycle progression (By similarity).
5. TNN: Extracellular matrix protein that seems to be a ligand for ITGA8:ITGB1, ITGAV:ITGB1 and ITGA4:ITGB1 (By similarity) (PubMed:17909022).
         Involved in neurite outgrowth and cell migration in hippocampal explants (By similarity).
         During endochondral bone formation, inhibits proliferation and differentiation of proteoblasts mediated by canonical WNT signaling (By similarity).
         In tumors, stimulates angiogenesis by elongation, migration and sprouting of endothelial cells (PubMed:19884327).
         Expressed in most mammary tumors, may facilitate tumorigenesis by supporting the migratory behavior of breast cancer cells
