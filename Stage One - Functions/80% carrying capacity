*Question*
Write a function for determining the time to reach 80% of the maximum growth; usually the carrying capacity.

_Answer_
carrying_cap_time <- function(time, od, threshold = 0.8){
    cap_threshold <- threshold * carrying_cap
    # Find the first time the population reaches or exceeds 80% of carrying capacity
    index <- which(pop_size >= cap_threshold)[1]
    return(time[index])
}
