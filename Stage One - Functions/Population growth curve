*Question*
Write a function that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve. Your function should include 2 extra parameters that randomize the length of the 
lag phase and the exponential phase. Most living populations follow a logistic population growth. Therefore, your growth curve can be: 
Population Size vs Time, Cell density vs Time, OD vs Time, CFU vs Time, etc

_Answer_
I will be modelling population size over time. using the formula N = K/1 + e-r(t-t0).
where: N = population size, K = carrying capacity, t = time(days), t0 = midpoint(time when growth is fastest, r = growth rate

population_growth <- function(carrying_cap, midpoint, growth_rate, lag_phase = 4, exp_phase = 10) {
    set.seed(42)  # For reproducibility

    # Define time points (Days 0 to 20)
    days <- 0:20  

    # Define parameters for logistic growth
    K <- carrying_cap  # Carrying capacity
    r <- growth_rate   # Growth rate
    t0 <- midpoint     # Midpoint of growth (inflection point)

    # Ensure the total phase length does not exceed available days
    if ((lag_phase + exp_phase) > length(days)) {
        stop("The sum of lag phase and exponential phase must not exceed 20 days.")
    }

    # Define phase days using input lengths
    lag_phase_days <- days[1:lag_phase]  # First few days for lag phase
    exp_phase_days <- days[(lag_phase + 1):(lag_phase + exp_phase)]  # Next days for exponential phase
    stationary_phase_days <- days[(lag_phase + exp_phase + 1):length(days)]  # Remaining days

    # Generate population size values
    pop_size <- numeric(length(days))

    # Lag phase: Constant low population
    pop_size[days %in% lag_phase_days] <- 0  

    # Exponential phase: Logistic growth
    exp_indices <- which(days %in% exp_phase_days)
    pop_size[exp_indices] <- K / (1 + exp(-r * (days[exp_indices] - t0)))

    # Stationary phase: Population stabilizes at carrying capacity
    pop_size[days %in% stationary_phase_days] <- K  

    # Plot the growth curve
    plot(days, pop_size, type = "b", pch = 16, col = "blue",
         xlab = "Days", ylab = "Population Size",
         main = "Logistic Growth Curve")
    abline(h=K, col="red", lty=2)  # Mark the carrying capacity

}

# Test the function with fixed lag and exponential phase lengths
test <- population_growth(100, 10, 0.6, lag_phase = 7, exp_phase = 10)
