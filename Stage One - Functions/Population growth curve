*Question*
Write a function that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve. Your function should include 2 extra parameters that randomize the length of the 
lag phase and the exponential phase [See population curve here] . Most living populations follow a logistic population growth. Therefore, your growth curve can be: 
Population Size vs Time, Cell density vs Time, OD vs Time, CFU vs Time, etc

Use 20 data points for time and population size
How can I generate series of number 20 days
How can I generate population size constant from day 0 to 3,increase day 4 to 15, constant from day 15 to 20
