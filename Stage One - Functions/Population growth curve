*Question*
Write a function that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve. Your function should include 2 extra parameters that randomize the length of the 
lag phase and the exponential phase. Most living populations follow a logistic population growth. Therefore, your growth curve can be: 
Population Size vs Time, Cell density vs Time, OD vs Time, CFU vs Time, etc

_Answer_
I will be modelling population size over time. using the formula N = K/1 + e-r(t-t0).
where: N = population size, K = carrying capacity, t = time(days), t0 = midpoint(time when growth is fastest, r = growth rate



Use 20 data points for time and population size
How can I generate series of number 20 days
How can I generate population size constant from day 0 to 3,increase day 4 to 15, constant from day 15 to 20
